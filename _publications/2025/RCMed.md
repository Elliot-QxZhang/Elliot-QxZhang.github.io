 Medical AI assistants offer valuable support to doctors in areas like disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, and report generation. However, significant gaps remain in their effectiveness in clinical scenarios. These include limited accuracy when processing multimodal content (both text and images) and a lack of validation of these models in real clinical settings. Here, we propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that enhances multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis for clinicians through hierarchical vision-language grounding. We establish a self-reinforcing correlation mechanism where visual features dynamically inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise spatial attention, creating a closed-loop system that progressively refines both modalities. The strong correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, which translates anatomical structures into semantically rich textual descriptors, enabling the model to learn intrinsic shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on a 20 million images-mask-description triplets dataset, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling across 165 clinical tasks with 9 different modalities. This work showcases how tightly integrated multi-modal foundation models inherently capture fine-grained, detailed patterns, enabling human-level interpretive capabilities in complex and sophisticated scenarios and marking a significant advancement in human-centric AI-driven healthcare.
