 ...In this paper, we propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that enhances multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis for clinicians through hierarchical vision-language grounding. Trained on a 20 million images-mask-description triplets dataset, RCMed achieves SOTA precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling across 165 clinical tasks with 9 different modalities...
