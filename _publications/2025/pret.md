  we introduce a novel paradigm, Pan-cancer Recognition via Examples without Training (PRET). The proposed PRET learns from a few examples during the inference phase without model fine-tuning, offering a flexible, scalable, and effective solution to recognize cancers across diverse organs, hospitals, and tasks using a single model only. Through extensive evaluations across international hospitals and diverse benchmarks, our method outperforms existing approaches across 20 tasks, achieving performances over 97% on 15 benchmarks at a maximum improvement of 36.76%.
