thoughts_on_life: "I’ve always believed in the motto: “The most precious gift God has ever given us is the world.” Beyond research, I’m passionate about water sports, including swimming (I’m a Level-2 athlete), surfing, windsurfing, and kayaking. I’m also deeply committed to global exploration and volunteer work. My travels have taken me to cities across countries such as China, Germany, Singapore, the United States, and Canada. For the past two years, I’ve spent my summer vacations in Sanya, China, volunteering as a coastal lifeguard, a meaningful experience I intend to continue in the years ahead. May god bless everyone, and may god bless me!"
